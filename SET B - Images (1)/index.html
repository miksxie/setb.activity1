            awaiting for her. This made her wonder if having these bunch of goals is an advantage for her or if this is just another

            things and trust the process as she tackles her journey in her chosen field. Despite of all the things she've experiencing as 
            a student, it didn't became a major obstacle to achieve her dreams. On July, 12 2023, she graduated from her Junior High School 
            life at City of Bacoor National Highschool with an honor and special award: Best in TLE. However, this isn't something that she 
            should brag about.
